# Audiowave – Audio Production Forensics (APF)

Upload a music clip → split into stems → tag instruments/FX → match samples → suggest sound-design recipes → return a readable report + JSON.

## Overview

Audiowave is a sophisticated audio analysis platform that acts as a "Shazam-for-techniques" - it takes music clips, separates them into stems, identifies instruments/FX, matches samples, and suggests sound design recipes. Think of it as a forensic audio detective that helps producers understand and recreate sounds.

## 🎵 What It Does

Upload a music clip (5-30 seconds) and get:
- **Instrument identification** (drums, bass, vocals, synths, etc.)
- **Technique detection** (reverb, delay, sidechain, autotune, etc.)
- **Tempo and key analysis** with confidence scores
- **Sample library matches** against licensed packs
- **Sound recreation recipes** with synth settings and FX chains

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Users
1. Upload a music clip (WAV/MP3, 5-30s)
2. Get instant analysis with confidence scores
3. View sample matches with proof snippets
4. Access sound recreation recipes
5. Download human-readable report

### For Developers
1. Read the [project specification](docs/architecture/context.yml)
2. Review [serverless deployment options](docs/architecture/serverless_architecture.yml)
3. Check the [API documentation](docs/api/)
4. Explore the [source code](src/)

## 🎯 Target Users

- **Content Creators**: YouTube producers making breakdown videos
- **Sample Rights Teams**: Labels checking for sample usage
- **Learning Producers**: Intermediate producers learning techniques

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Source Separation**: HT-Demucs for stem isolation
- **Audio Analysis**: Essentia/librosa for features
- **Instrument Tagging**: PANNs CNN14 for classification
- **Sample Matching**: Landmark-based fingerprinting
- **Recipe Generation**: Rule-based + optional neural embeddings
- **Deployment**: Serverless-first architecture

## 📊 Current Status

- **Phase**: Planning & Architecture
- **MVP Timeline**: 2 weeks
- **Target Genres**: Trap, House
- **Deployment**: Serverless (Google Colab Pro+ → Hugging Face → AWS)
